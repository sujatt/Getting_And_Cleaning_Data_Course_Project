# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
This repository contains a link to my submissions for the final course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".
In this respository, you will find an R script to clean the project data and a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations that were undertaken to tidy the code.
