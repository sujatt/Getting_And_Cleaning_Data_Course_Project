## README
This repository contains a link to my submissions for the final course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". In this respository, you will find an R script to clean the project data and a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations that were undertaken to tidy the code.

To run the script "run_analysis.R", simply type "source(run_analysis.R)" in your R prompt.
Thank you!
